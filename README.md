**Description:** 
The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league comprising 32 teams divided into two conferences: the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). Each conference is further segmented into four divisions, each consisting of four teams. Each of these teams plays a 17-game regular season (they previously played 16-game regular seasons prior to 2021). Across these 17 games, teams play for a spot in the playoffs, where the top teams from each conference compete to reach the Super Bowl, the NFL’s championship game.

Our analysis focuses on examining the relationship between player salaries and team success. Player salaries in the NFL vary significantly based on a player’s position, skill level, experience, and contract negotiations. Conversely, team success is typically assessed by win-loss records, playoff appearances, and ultimately, their performance in the postseason.

The issue we are seeking to explore is whether a high payroll, which generally signifies higher salaries for players, correlates with enhanced team performance. While it may seem logical that more expensive players would produce better results, various factors might influence the outcome. Through our analysis, we aim to uncover patterns or insights into how player compensation relates to overall team success.
